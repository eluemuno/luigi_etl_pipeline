# luigi_etl_pipeline

This is my earlier implementation of the luigi ETL pipeline, parsing sample parquet, avro, csv and oca files. THe output can then be picked by another process and written to a DB or straight to a reporting dashboard.

I will be implementing and db integration (couchbase, mongo, mysql) eventually as an enhancement.
